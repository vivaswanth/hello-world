# hello-world
Beginning of my journey into new era...!!

In a way, i lived 18 years of my life in a childish manner...
but today is some what important because, till now i faced many problems and also im happy but something is missing, the flavour.
i was completely known to none (even myself.. i dont understand myself sometimes) and though i had some goals, never accomplished them successfully.
but today i was pretty much vexed with myself.
So time to repair, clean all the unwanted trash, do some major modifications in all aspects of my life.

i decided to change...not to compromise on my dreams...
and yes....i want to be an ethical hacker....
